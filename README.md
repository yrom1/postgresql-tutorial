# Postgresql-cheetsheet...(s)

This repo is for personal use, to review https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/ quickly.

I generally don't explain anything and just provide SQL / PL/pgSQL code snippets so I can read it to remember Postgres's syntax. If something doesn't make sense you can search for the header name and find the article explaining it. Occassionally something was so unusal or counter-intuitive that I noted it with additional comments, so I wouldn't mis-understand it on subsequent readings.
